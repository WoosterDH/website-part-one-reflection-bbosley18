Through my website I hope that my audience will be able to gain a glimpse of me and my research and work experience. Thus, when I was designing my website I wanted to tell a story of my educational background. When going about designing the website, I had trouble linking the pages; however, upon talking with Dr. Heil I was able to quickly solve my problem.  Additionally, I had trouble creating buttons to link to different pages and fixing my images of my research to link to the pages as well. After figuring out the challenges I had, I kept on asking myself what new items I could add to my digital work environment. Throughout my experience working on my website, I am really proud of my new header because it reminds me of my summer abroad.
