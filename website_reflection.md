# Website Reflection Prompt

Please write for me ~200 words reflecting on the following:
  * What is the story that you set out to tell with your website and how did you have to make decisions along the way to achieve that vision? 
  * Where did you find challenges in this assignment?
  * How did you challenge yourself?
  * In what aspects do you take particular pride?

This will be considered as part of the evaluation for the first part of the Website project.

~~**Your response goes here**~~

Through my website I hope that my audience will be able to gain a glimpse of me and my research and work experience. Thus, when I was designing my website I wanted to tell a story of my educational background. When going about designing the website, I had trouble linking the pages; however, upon talking with Dr. Heil I was able to quickly solve my problem.  Additionally, I had trouble creating buttons to link to different pages and fixing my images of my research to link to the pages as well. After figuring out the challenges I had, I kept on asking myself what new items I could add to my digital work environment. Throughout my experience working on my website, I am really proud of my new header because it reminds me of my summer abroad.

> Thanks, Blaire. You've clearly taken the time to test out your site and to experiment. That's great; it's really what this assignment is about. You also have a great articulation of the future (technical) goals that you'd like to achieve: you want to play around with the opacity of images and you're thinking about trying to figure out how to (I think) have mouse-overs do some work for you. This would continue to push your skills, I think, and I'll encourage you to talk with me about your progress in these directions. Also think more about the story you want to tell *about* your educational background. You're focusing and that's good, but what's your story? Overall, well done and I'll look forward to seeing it develop. ~JAH
